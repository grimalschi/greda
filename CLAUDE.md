Guidance for working in this repo (**greda**). Read this first.

## What this is
Offline-first PWA for studying Spanish by reading public-domain works adapted into
graded Spanish (levels **A1–C2**; most works A2–C1) with **per-sentence Russian translations**.
UI is in Russian. No backend and no runtime LLM calls — all content is pre-generated static JSON
in `public/content/`. The library holds **300+ works**: 5 originals (Poe/London) + ~263
public-domain detective & sci-fi stories + **44 canonical classics added 2026-06-16**
(Frankenstein, Dracula, Verne, Tarzan, Austen, Dickens, Brontës, Twain, Wilde, Collins, Leblanc,
Leroux, Dumas, Hugo, …). All from Project Gutenberg. Long novels are **multi-chapter** (4–11 ch);
short stories are single-chapter (complete arc).

## Commands
- `npm run dev` — dev server at http://localhost:5173/greda/
- `npm run validate` — validate all content vs JSON schemas + cross-checks. Run after ANY content change.
- `npm run build:catalog` — **regenerate `catalog.json` from all `work.json` AND normalize every `work.json` to the schema** (strips stray fields). Run before validate after adding/editing works.
- `npm run build` — `tsc -b` typecheck + Vite production build to `dist/`.
- `npm run preview` — serve the built bundle locally.

CI runs validate → build → deploy on every push to `main`.

## Architecture
- Vite + React + TS. `base` is `/greda/` (GitHub Pages project site). Uses **`HashRouter`** so deep links work on Pages.
- PWA via `vite-plugin-pwa` (Workbox), `registerType: 'autoUpdate'`. **The service worker precaches only the app shell** (JS/CSS/HTML/icons ≈ 200 KB). **Content JSON is served via `NetworkFirst` runtime caching** (`greda-content` cache): fresh from network when online, served from cache offline / for already-opened works. This replaced the old "precache everything" strategy, which at 268 works (~16 MB) made first load heavy and caused the catalog to get stuck in a stale SW cache. See `workbox` in `vite.config.ts`.
- State (settings + reading progress) lives in `localStorage` under key `greda:v1`, managed by `src/state/store.tsx` (`useAppState()`). Theme/font-size applied via `data-theme`/`data-font-size` on `<html>` + CSS variables in `src/styles.css`.
- Content is fetched at runtime from `public/content/` via `src/lib/content.ts` (uses `import.meta.env.BASE_URL`). Loading/error via `useAsync` (`src/hooks/`).
- Routes (`src/App.tsx`): `/` home · `/work/:workId` · `/read/:workId/:level/:chapterId` · `/settings`. Pages in `src/pages/`. The home page has search + genre filter (needed at 268 works).

## Content model
`public/content/`:
- `catalog.json` — home-screen index. **GENERATED** by `npm run build:catalog` from all `work.json`; do NOT hand-edit.
- `authors/<authorId>.json`
- `works/<workId>/work.json` — metadata + `levels.<level>.{available,chapterCount}`.
- `works/<workId>/levels/<level>/manifest.json` — chapter list (`sentenceCount` per chapter).
- `works/<workId>/levels/<level>/chapter-NNN.json` — paragraphs → sentences (`text` = ES, `translationRu` = RU).
- `works/<workId>/source/` — original public-domain text + metadata (only the 5 originals). **Never shown in the app.**

Schemas in `schemas/`. The validator (`scripts/validate-content.mjs`) enforces them plus:
`workId`/`level` fields match the file location, `sentenceCount` equals the real count,
`catalog.availableLevels` matches `work.json` available levels, ids are unique.

### ID rules (enforced)
- `para-001`, `para-002`, … (3 digits) — sequential within a chapter.
- `sent-001`, … (3 digits) — sequential across the WHOLE chapter (not reset per paragraph).
- `chapter-001`, … (3 digits).

### Adding / changing content
1. Write/edit `chapter-NNN.json` (+ `manifest.json`) under the level, and `work.json` (levels available + chapterCount).
2. `npm run build:catalog` (rebuilds `catalog.json`, normalizes `work.json`).
3. `npm run validate` until clean, then `npm run build`.

## Content sources & generation (out-of-app, one-time)
- **All sources are public domain from Project Gutenberg** (gutenberg.org, first published ≤1930 → US public domain).
- **`content-sources.json`** (repo root) — manifest mapping every generated work → its Gutenberg URL, author, year, container, raw-text file.
- **`sources/`** (repo root, NOT under `public/`, NOT deployed) — the 67 raw Gutenberg text files, preserved for reproducibility.
- Generation pipeline used: research subagents compiled & verified the Gutenberg list → orchestrator downloaded sources locally → batches of 10 subagents each read a local source and wrote 4 levels + `work.json` → `build:catalog` → `validate` → commit/push per batch. Per-work generation spec/guidance: `prompts/adaptation.md`. Soft-shorten only — never drop whole plot scenes; a few long novels are condensed into one chapter.
- Working files (gitignored): `.gen-plan.json`, `.plan/`.

## Conventions
- TS strict with `verbatimModuleSyntax` → import types with `import type { … }`.
- UI strings are Russian; reading content is Spanish with Russian **sentence** translations only (no word-level glossary/tokens — out of scope).
- Never render original source text.

## Deploy
Push `main` → `.github/workflows/deploy.yml` (validate → build → Pages). Pages is already
enabled (source = GitHub Actions). Live: https://grimalschi.github.io/greda/.

## GitHub access
Use a fine-grained PAT scoped to this repo only, passed **inline per command** as `GH_TOKEN`
(never `gh auth login`, never in the remote URL or `.git/config`). Revoke after use.
